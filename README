== Flight Control Board (FCB) ==
The fcb-bring-up branch is currently used as a branch to get things up and running.

The fcb project contains an empty main file and a bunch of STM drivers etc.

The demo\Test_STM32F303 project contains a demo project found online. It's based on the STM32F4Discovery demo.
